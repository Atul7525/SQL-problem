P(R) represents a pattern drawn by Julia in R rows. The following pattern represents P(5):
solution 1:
with cte as (
select 1 as id
union all
select id+1 from cte where id<20
)
select REPLICATE('*   ',id) as half_pyramid from cte

solution 2:
DECLARE @COUNTER INT
SET @COUNTER = 1

WHILE (@COUNTER < 21)
BEGIN
	PRINT REPLICATE('* ', @COUNTER)
	SET @COUNTER = @COUNTER+1
END
